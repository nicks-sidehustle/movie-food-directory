            <h1>About Foods in Movies</h1>
            <p>Have you ever watched a movie and thought, "I really want to eat that"? You're in the right place.</p>
            <p>Foods in Movies is a passion project dedicated to exploring the powerful connection between the movies we love and the food we crave. From the simple joy of a slice of pizza in an 80s comedy to the lavish feasts of historical dramas, we believe that food on film is more than just a prop—it's a character.</p>
            <p>We dive deep into different decades, uncovering the trends, the stories, and the fun behind cinema's most iconic culinary moments. And if you're inspired to bring some of that magic into your own kitchen, we'll point you to the gear and goodies to make it happen.</p>
            <p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
